Solutions for daily problems
Merely an exercise to keep up the spirit
Each daily problem has an own branch X.1 and X.2 (the first day failed to meet the branch criteria, though)

Day 15, problem a isn't the right file. I did copy the wrong file and original file is overwritten. Must edit it from the problem b again...
